# I-am-Me

Hello, **I'm Ayanda Ayoola**, but you can call me **AY**. I'm a passionate data enthusiast and data analyst. My world revolves around data. I enjoy delving into datasets, uncovering valuable insights, and using data-driven approaches to make informed decisions. Apart from my data adventures, I also have a deep love for reading and writing.
